First you have to make tikki with a potato and fry it , then put it in between the two buns . 
Then we have to slice some vegies like tomato , cocumber , onion  etc 
then we have to make pizza saus with the help of tomato or we can also take 
it for any shop .
then we just have to put all the things between the to buns ,
First take a base of bun and apply some Mayonnaise on it.
Then take some cocumber and onion slices and put it over the base of the bun .
then take the tikki , which we had made using the potato and put it on the vegies 
and after putting it , take two leaves of lettuse and put it over the tikki. Then take some 
pizza saus and apply it on the lettuse leaves then put some cheese slice on it and on the silce 
put some tomato slice and at last put the second piece of the bun .... AND SURVE IN A PLATE AND ENJOY :)
